# 自动播放

## 前言

Chrome's autoplay policies are simple:

- Muted autoplay is always allowed.
  - Autoplay with sound is allowed if:
  - The user has interacted with the domain (click, tap, etc.).
  - On desktop, the user's Media Engagement Index threshold has been crossed, meaning the user has previously played video with sound.
  - The user has added the site to their home screen on mobile or installed the PWA on desktop.
- Top frames can delegate autoplay permission to their iframes to allow autoplay with sound.
